== Introduction

In this article, I will show how to display and customize a graph in a browser with the help of http://sigmajs.org[SigmaJS],
a JS library dedicated to graph drawing delivered under the https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT[MIT licence].

Initially, SigmaJS has been developed for https://gephi.org/[Gephi] to export a graph on the web.
Today, http://sigmajs.org[SigmaJS] is a thin, full features, highly configurable graph library
and the small "plus" that make the difference is its compatibility with touch screen.

== Installation

=== How-to

There are four steps to follow :

*Step 1 : Install SigmaJS binaries*

http://sigmajs.org[SigmaJS] can be found on :

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/sigma[NPM] : you just have to type : `npm sigma --save-dev`
* https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/releases[Github] : download the `build.zip` from a release like https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/releases/download/v1.2.0/build.zip[this]

*Step 2 : Import the JavaScript library in your web page*

The minimal script you have to load is : `<script src="./build/sigma.min.js"></script>`.

Personally, I prefer to import all the source files, it permits to lighten the library by removing the unused source files (ex: I don't need SVG & Webgl renderers if I use canvas).

*Step 3 :  Create an HTML container*

You have to create an HTML element, for example a `div` with an `id` like this : `<div id='sigma-container'></div>`.

Moreover, you also need to give an `height` and `width` to it, otherwise it will has a size of 0 pixel.
This easily done with some CSS : `#sigma-container { width:100%, height:100%}`

*Step 4: Initialise SigmaJS*

To initialise SigmaJS, you need to call the function `sigma` with those arguments :

* A render : it contains the HTML element where sigma will display the graph, plus the type of renderer (SVG, canvas or WebGL)
* sigma's settings : this object will override the default settings, so you can pass an empty object for now. The complete list settings is available https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/wiki/Settings[here]

At the end, you should have something like that :

[source, xml]
----
<html>
  <head>
    <title>SigmaJS example</title>
    <script src="./build/sigma.min.js"></script>
    <style>
      html { height:100%;}
      body {height: 100%;}
      #sigma-container { width:100%; height:100%; background-color:#E1E1E1}
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id='sigma-container'></div>
    <script>
      ...
      // Initialise sigma:
      var s = new sigma(
        {
           renderer: {
             container: document.getElementById('sigma-container'),
             type: 'canvas'
           },
           settings: {}
         }
       );
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

=== How to choose between SVG, Canvas and Webgl ?

http://sigmajs.org[SigmaJS] can used one this technology to display your graph : *svg*, *canvas* & *webgl*.

*SVG* is a markup language, directly interpreted by your browser,
so it's easy to customize the style of nodes & edges, you just have to add some CSS rules.
But when you apply a layout algorithm on the graph, you continuously change the DOM of the SVG,
and if this DOM is heavy, the result is slow and can freeze your browser.

*Canvas* is an HTML5 element compatible with all the modern browsers.
It defines a space on your web page where you can draw some pixels by using a JavaScript PI.
The JavaScript code is directly interpreted by your browser and it decide to what render and when.
Due to this, Canvas scales more than the SVG, but if you want to change the color of a form, you need a mechanism to specify it in the code.

On the other hand, there is *WebGL*, that is compatible with almost newest modern browsers (even if the API is not stable everywhere).
As in Canvas, you need to write some JavaScript code to render your visualisation (it's not the same JavaScript API),
but this time, its computation is delegated to *OpenGL* so to your *GPU*.

To resume :

[%header,cols=4*]
|===

|
| *SVG*
| *Canvas*
| *WebGL*

| *Browser compatibility*
| ALL (even old one)
| ALL
| Modern browsers

| *Render phases*
| SVG creation > Browser parsing > Browser rendering
| JS code > Browser rendering
| JS Code > OpenGL rendering

| *Performance* +
to display a large graph (more than 1000 elements)
| Slow
| Normal
| Performant

|===

So the choice will depend of your needs, and also of the http://sigmajs.org[SigmaJS] plugins you want to use (plugins are not compatible with every formats).

I suggest you to choose *Canvas* or *Webgl* if you want to really display a big graph.

== The SigmaJS graph structure

=== Definition

Now that sigma is initiate, we need to give it a graph.
It structure is simple : an object with an array of nodes and an array of edges.

[%header,cols='1,1,2,3',title='Node definition']
|===

| Field
| Type
| Required
| Description

| `id`
| Any
| Yes
| Node identifier, must be unique across all the node

| `label`
| String
| No
|

| `x` & `y`
| Float
| Yes
| Position of the node in 2D. Can be initialize with `Math.random()`.

| `size`
| Float
| No  _(0)_
| Size of the node that is use to render it.

| `color`
| Color RGB
| No _(`defaultNodeColor`)_
| Color used to display the node.

|===

[%header,cols='1,1,2,3',title='Edge definition']
|===

| Field
| Type
| Required
| Description

| `id`
| Any
| Yes
| Edge identifier, must be unique across all the edge.

| `source`
| Any
| Yes
| Starting node's identifier of the edge.

| `target`
| Any
| Yes
| Ending node's identifier of the edge.

| `type`
| `line`, `curve`, `arrow` or `curvedArrow`
| No _(line)_
| Edge type for its render. The choice will depend on :

- do you want to display an oriented graph ? if so, you need an arrow type.

- do you want to display many edges between two edges ? If so you need a arrow type.

| `size`
| Float
| No _(`minEdgeSize`)_
| Size of the edge that is use to render it.

| `color`
| Color RGB
| No _(`defaultEdgeColor`)_
| Color used to display the edge.

|===

=== Example

[source, javascript]
----
var graph = {
  nodes: [
    { id: "n0", label: "A node", x: 0, y: 0, size: 3, color: '#008cc2' },
    { id: "n1", label: "Another node", x: 3, y: 1, size: 2, color: '#008cc2' },
    { id: "n2", label: "And a last one", x: 1, y: 3, size: 1, color: '#E57821' }
  ],
  edges: [
    { id: "e0", source: "n0", target: "n1", color: '#282c34', type:'line', size:0.5 },
    { id: "e1", source: "n1", target: "n2", color: '#282c34', type:'curve', size:1},
    { id: "e2", source: "n2", target: "n0", color: '#FF0000', type:'line', size:2}
  ]
}

=== Loading graph in sigma

Sigma has a complete API to manage its graph data. I let you see the https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/wiki/Graph-API[API documentation].

To load a graph in sigma, you just have to call the method `read` on the sigma graph instance : `s.graph.read(graph)`

Once it's done, we need to tell sigma to draw the graph by calling its `refresh` function : `s.refresh()`

== Graph layout algorithm

=== Definition

What is hard in displaying a graph is to rapidly display it in such a way
that we can see all nodes and their edges without overlaps (in fact the less as possible).
To do it, we need an algorithm that will compute the position of each nodes, and the most known for that are the **force-directed** algorithms.

The principle is simple, you need to consider two forces :

[%header,cols='1a,1a']
|===

| Repulsive
| Attractive

| Each node repulse the others. You can consider nodes like particle with the same electric charge.
| Two nodes with an edge, attract themselves. You can consider an edge as a spring

| image::/public/images/sigmajs/repulsion.png[]
| image::/public/images/sigmajs/attraction.png[]

|===

Then you run an algorithm that compute on each iteration, the sum of the applied forces on each node, and move them in consequence.
After a number of iteration, you will see that graph is in a stable state.

=== Force-Atlas2

http://sigmajs.org[SigmaJS] include (as a plugin) a forced-directed algorithm called *Force-Atlas2*.

To use it, you need to :

* *Step 1 : import the plugin files*

[source, xml]
----
<script src="./build/plugins/sigma.layout.forceAtlas2/supervisor.js"></script>
<script src="./build/plugins/sigma.layout.forceAtlas2/worker.js"></script>
----

* *Step 2 : Run it*

Now that the plugin is loaded, we can directly call it on the sigma instance : `s.startForceAtlas2()`;
This creates a https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Utilisation_des_web_workers[web worker] where all the algorithm iterations will be calculated.

* *Step 3 (optional) : Stop it*

The algorithm won't stop by itself, so I recommend you to stop it after a predefined duration (10 seconds in my example) : `window.setTimeout(function() {s.killForceAtlas2()}, 10000)`;

== Plugins

http://sigmajs.org[SigmaJS] has a lot of plugins, you can see the list https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/tree/master/plugins[here].
I will not show you all of them, so I have done a list of my most used plugins.

=== Edge labels

This plugin allows you to add a label on each edge. I mainly use it to display the Neo4j's relationship type.

To use it :

* import the needed script (in my case `settings.js`, `sigma.canvas.edges.labels.def.js` & `sigma.canvas.edges.labels.curvedArrow.js`)
* Add a `label` property on yours edges

++++
<script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/sim51/uzmxvg3u/embed/result,js/"></script>
++++

=== Relative size

This plugin is really useful when you want to see which node is most connected.
The size of the node depends of its degree, ie. its number of in-going & outgoing edges.
