== Goals

During this post, we will use Neo4j and JCDecaux opendata API, to find the % nearest stations from my position, with a free bike.
I will show you how to design your graph, to load the dataset from the JSON API, and make some queries. As a bonus I have also build a simple javascript application to display the result.

Let's start !

== JCDecaux model

JCDecaux provide an API to get all the information about their bicycle services. All is documentated here : https://developer.jcdecaux.com

INFO: you need to create an API key to use the API. On my examples you should replace the `@JCD_TOKEN_API@` by your own.

By reading the https://developer.jcdecaux.com/#/opendata/vls?page=dynamic[real-time API documentation], we can compute that JCD is using the following schema :

[graphviz]
----
digraph finite_state_machine {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [
         shape = Mrecord
    ];

    // NODES
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    CONTRACT [label = "Contract | name: String* \lcommercial_name: String* \lcountry_code: String* \lcities: String[]*\l" ];
    STATION [label = "Station | number: integer* \lname: String* \laddress: String* \lposition: Point* \lbanking: Boolean \lbonus : Boolean\lstatus: String* \lbike_stands: integer* \lavailable_bike_stands: : integer* \lavailable_bikes: integer* \llast_update: Long*\l"];


    // EDGES
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    CONTRACT-> STATION [label = "Join on `contract_name`"];
}
----

So we have two entities, related together : it's a graph ! But can we do a better graph modelisation ?

If you look at the `Contract` entity, you can see :

* a dependency to a country
* a list of cities

So let's explode this entity like this :

[graphviz]
----
digraph finite_state_machine {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [
         shape = Mrecord
    ];

    // NODES
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    CONTRACT [label = "Contract | name: String* \lcommercial_name: String* \l"];
    COUNTRY [label = "Country | code: String*"];
    CITY [label = "City | name: String*"];

    // EDGES
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    CONTRACT -> CITY [label = "FOR_CITY"];
    CITY -> COUNTRY [label = "IS_LOCALIZED_IN"];
}
----

And what can we do about the `Station` entity ? It's easy we can split it into two parts :

* The station (static data)
* The state of the station (ie. ephemeral data)

[graphviz]
----
digraph finite_state_machine {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [
         shape = Mrecord
    ];

    // NODES
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    STATION [label = "Station |number: integer* \lname: String* \laddress: String* \lposition: Point* \lbanking: Boolean \lbonus : Boolean \l"];
    STATE [label="State |  status: String* \lbike_stands: integer* \lavailable_bike_stands: : integer* \lavailable_bikes: integer* \llast_update: Long* \l"];

    // EDGES
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    STATION -> STATE [label = "LAST_STATE"];
}
----

And what if I want to keep the state history ?
So let's create a chain of `State` nodes.

[graphviz]
----
digraph finite_state_machine {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [
         shape = Mrecord
    ];

    // NODES
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    STATION [label = "Station |number: integer* \lname: String* \laddress: String* \lposition: Point* \lbanking: Boolean \lbonus : Boolean \l"];
    STATE [label="State |  status: String* \lbike_stands: integer* \lavailable_bike_stands: : integer* \lavailable_bikes: integer* \llast_update: Long* \l"];

    // EDGES
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    STATION -> STATE [label = "LAST_STATE"];
    STATE -> STATE [label = "PREVIOUS_STATE"];
}
----

I have chosen this modeling, because my main goal is to get the last updated state, and with this one, I just have to traverse one relationship.

So the final schema looks like that :

[graphviz]
----
digraph finite_state_machine {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [
         shape = Mrecord
    ];

    // NODES
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    CONTRACT [label = "Contract | name: String* \lcommercial_name: String* \l"];
    COUNTRY [label = "Country | code: String*"];
    CITY [label = "City | name: String*"];
    STATION [label = "Station |number: integer* \lname: String* \laddress: String* \lposition: Point* \lbanking: Boolean \lbonus : Boolean \l"];
    STATE [label="State |  status: String* \lbike_stands: integer* \lavailable_bike_stands: : integer* \lavailable_bikes: integer* \llast_update: Long* \l"];

    // EDGES
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    CONTRACT -> CITY [label = "FOR_CITY"];
    CITY -> COUNTRY [label = "IS_LOCALIZED_IN"];
    CITY -> STATION [label = "HAS_STATION"];
    STATION -> STATE [label = "LAST_STATE"];
    STATE -> STATE [label = "PREVIOUS_STATE"];
}
----

Now that we have our model, let see how to load the data.

== Imports

=== APOC

Before to start, you need to install https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures[APOC]. APOC is a collection of very usefull procedure for Neo4j.

This how to install it :

* Download the jar here : https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/download
* Put it into the neo4j `plugin` directory
* Restart your server

=== Constraints

Now we have to declare some constraints on our model, with all the unique keys :

[source,cypher]
----
// Contract name is unique
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:Contract) ASSERT n.name IS UNIQUE;

// Country code is unique
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:Country) ASSERT n.code IS UNIQUE;

// Station ID is a composition of the contract's name and the station id.
// Because the number field into the Station entity is only unique inside a contract
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:Station) ASSERT n.id IS UNIQUE;

// State id is a composition of the station id plus the last_update timestamp
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:State) ASSERT n.id IS UNIQUE;
----

You can note here, that I haven't create a constraint on cities. This is just because two countries can have a city with the same name.
But we can create an index on it if we want to speed up our queries that are based on this field

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX ON :City(name);
----

=== Importing all contracts

We will import all contracts of JCDecaux. To do this, there is an endpoint : `https://api.jcdecaux.com/vls/v1/contracts`

[source,cypher]
----
WITH '@JCD_TOKEN_API@' AS key
CALL apoc.load.json('https://api.jcdecaux.com/vls/v1/contracts?apiKey=' + key) YIELD value as row
    MERGE (contract:Contract { name: row.name, commercial_name:row.commercial_name })
    MERGE (country:Country { code: row.country_code })
    WITH row, contract, country
      UNWIND row.cities AS cityName
          MERGE (country)-[:HAS_CITY]->(city:City { name: cityName })
          MERGE (contract)-[:FOR_CITY]->(city)
----

=== Importing station with their state

Now we are going to create stations with their data, for all contract, with the help of this endpoint : `https://api.jcdecaux.com/vls/v1/stations?contract=@contract_name@`

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
    "MATCH (c:Contract) RETURN c",
    "WITH '@JCD_TOKEN_API@' AS key , {c} AS contract
        CALL apoc.load.json('https://api.jcdecaux.com/vls/v1/stations?contract=' + contract.name + '&apiKey=' + key) YIELD value as row

            // we can find the same station number on two contracts, so the unique id is a compisition of the id and the contract
            MERGE (contract)-[:HAS_STATION]->(station:Station {id: row.contract_name + '_' + row.number})
                ON CREATE SET
                    station.number = row.number,
                    station.name = row.name,
                    station.address = row.address,
                    station.lat = row.position.lat,
                    station.lng = row.position.lng,
                    station.banking = row.banking,
                    station.bonus = row.bonus

            // to have a unique id, I'm using a composition of the station id and the last_update timetsamp
            MERGE (state:State {id: station.id + '_' + row.last_update})
                ON CREATE SET
                    state.status = row.status,
                    state.available_bikes = row.available_bikes,
                    state.bike_stands = row.bike_stands,
                    state.available_bike_stands = row.available_bike_stands

            WITH station, state
                MERGE (station)-[:LAST_STATE]->(state)

                // Here we remove the previous `LAST_STATE` rel if it exists, and we create the chain
                WITH station, state
                    MATCH (old:State)<-[r:LAST_STATE]-(station)-[:LAST_STATE]->(state)
                    WHERE NOT id(old) =id(state)
                    WITH old, r, state
                    CREATE (state)-[:PREVIOUS]->(old)
                    DELETE r",
    {batchSize:1,parallel:true}) YIELD batches, total, errorMessages
----

First instruction is `apoc.periodic.iterate`. It's a APOC procedure that takes 3 parameters:

  * A cypher query that give a first collection of results
  * An other cypher query that will be applied on each result from the first one
  * Some configurations, here `{batchSize:1,parallel:true}`

Basically, it's the same as a `WITH` (ie. to iterate over the result of a query), with the ability to create some batches (based on the first query), and optionally to parallelize them.

So here, I'm just creating one job per `Contract`, to create all the corresponding `Station` with theirs `State`.

You can replay this script every 5 minutes, to update the state of each station.
To do this you can create a `cron` task, or you also can use the `apoc.periodic.repeat` procedure (Job are not persisted, so you will have to re-create it after each restart of neo4j).

At the end you should have a graph like this

== Some cool stuff

Now that we have the data, we can ask to the database, what is the nearest station from me with an available bike :

[source,cypher]
----
WITH point({latitude: 56.7, longitude: 12.6}) as my_position
MATCH (station:Station)-[:LAST_STATE]->(state:State)
WHERE state.status = "OPEN" AND state.available_bikes > 0
RETURN station, distance(point({latitude: station.lat, longitude: station.lng}), poi)  AS distance
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 5
----

As you can see I'm using two new functions of Neo4j 3.1 :

* *point( { latitude: XXX, longitude: XXX} ) :* allow you to create a geospatial point in WGS-83 projection
* *distance( point, point) :* will returned the geodesic distance between the two points.

We can have a better performances, if we create those two indexes :

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX ON :State(available_bikes);
CREATE INDEX ON :State(status);
----

To see the differences, just makes an explain before and after the creations of these indexes.

And what if we display this result directly on a map ?
Nothing easier, Cypher can produce some JSON result, so let's change the result to produce a geojson :

[source,cypher]
----
WITH point({latitude: 56.7, longitude: 12.6}) as my_position
MATCH (station:Station)-[:LAST_STATE]->(state:State)
WHERE state.status = "OPEN" AND state.available_bikes > 0
WITH station, state, distance(point({latitude: station.lat, longitude: station.lng}), my_position)  AS distance
ORDER BY  distance
LIMIT 5
WITH collect( {
        type: 'Feature',
        geometry: {
            type: 'Point',
            coordinates: [station.lng, station.lat]
        },
        properties : {
            name : station.name,
            distance: round(distance),
            address : station.address,
            free_bike: state.available_bikes,
            free_slot: state.available_bike_stands
        }
    }) AS features
RETURN  { type: 'FeatureCollection', features: features } AS geojson
----

To see the result, you can copy/paste the json result on http://geojson.io/

Or you can also build a simple webpage to display the result with http://leafletjs.com/[Leaflet], https://gist.github.com/sim51/409c769d0501956549221449ca845360[like this one].
