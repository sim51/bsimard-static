== Market solutions

There are two market solutions to make an ODBC-JDBC bridge :

* Easysoft with their ODBC-JDBC Gateway
* Openlink with thier Single/Multi Tier ODBC-JDBC bridge

In this documentation, we will only talk about *easysoft*.

== Easysoft

*Easysoft* is a solution that make an ODBC-JDBC bridge on your computer.
So you have to install it on each machine.

It costs *375 GBD / year*, but prices depend on the number of machines where we install software.

== Installation

* Go to download trial version : http://www.easysoft.com/cgi-bin/productdownload.cgi?p=26 (you must create an account)
* Download the windows version
* Run the executable and follow the wizard. For more information, read the installation guide of easysoft

== JVM Configuration

* Go to Programs > Easysoft >ODBC-JDBC Gateway > Configure Java Interface
* Configure where is your JDK
* Click on Test and Save if OK

== NEO4J JDBC Configuration

* Go to the Control Panel
* Then in Administrative Tools
* Click on Data Sources (ODBC)
* Check if Easysoft driver is really installed

* Download the neo4j jdbc driver (with all its dependencies) here : https://m2.neo4j.org/content/groups/public/org/neo4j/neo4j-jdbc/2.1.4/
* Create a new ODBC connection, and select Easysoft ODBC-JDBC Gateway

* Configure the connection where :
** *DSN :* The name of your new database, for example NEO4J
** *Description :* you can put here the description of your connection
** *User name :* The login of the neo4j user
** *Password :* the password of the neo4j user
** *Driver Class :* org.neo4j.jdbc.Driver
** *Class Path :* Click on the Add button, and select the jar you have download at step 5
** *URL :* The JDBC connection URL for neo4j : jdbc:neo4j://localhost:7474 (if you server is on your local machine)

* When you have fullfil this form, you can click on the `Test`, to check that is everyting is good (your neo4j server must running of course).

Well done, you  have your ODBC-JDBC Bridge installed for neo4j !

=== How to enabled log for ODBC

This feature can be (very) usefull for debugging purpose, but it (really) slowing the ODBC connection.

* Go to the `Control Panel`
* Then in `Administrative Tools`
* Click on `Data Sources (ODBC)`
* Click on the `Tracing` tab
* Click on `Start Tracing Now`. You can also configure where the log file is generated with the `Log File Path`.
