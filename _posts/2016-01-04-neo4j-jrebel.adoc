In this tutorial, I will show you how to install and to use Jrebel with Neo4j. This is usefull to be more productive in development mode, because it avoid the 'build/compile/deploy/restart/test' loop.

== Installation

=== Step 1 : download & licence

You have to download JRebel and to ask a trial code. For this, follow those instructions :

* Got to the website and fullfill the form to get an activation code : https://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/download/
* Then download a stand alone version here : https://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/download/#!/have-license

=== Step 2 : Installation

Unzip the downloaded file somwhere in your computer. In my case : `$> unzip jrebel-6.3.1-nosetup.zip -d ~/tmp/`. Now you should have a *jrebel* folder on your computer. In the rest of this tuto, I will use the var `JREBEL_HOME` for the path of this folder.

=== Step 3 : Activation

We have to activate JRebel with the trial code that we have asked. To do this, we only have to execute this commande : `$>JREBEL_HOME/bin/activate.sh <ACTIVATION_CODE>` (replace `<ACTIVATION_CODE>` with the one given at step 1)

Now you have a trial version of JRebel installed on your computer

=== Configuration for Neo4j

Here, I’m assuming that you already have a neo4j instance installed on your computer in the folder `NEO4J_HOME`

So now we have to configure JRebel for Neo4j. JRebel works with a java agent, so we have to add it in the JVM argument of Neo4j.

To do this, follow those instructions :

* Edit the file `NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j-wrapper.conf` : `$> vi NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j-wrapper.conf`
* Add this line in the JVM Parameters section : `wrapper.java.additional=-javaagent: JREBEL_HOME/jrebel.jar`

Now your configuration file should looks like this :

[source,property]
----
#********************************************************************
# Property file references
#********************************************************************

wrapper.java.additional=-Dorg.neo4j.server.properties=conf/neo4j-server.properties
wrapper.java.additional=-Dlog4j.configuration=file:conf/log4j.properties

#********************************************************************
# JVM Parameters
#********************************************************************

wrapper.java.additional=-XX:+UseG1GC
wrapper.java.additional=-XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow
wrapper.java.additional=-XX:hashCode=5
wrapper.java.additional=-javaagent:/home/bsimard/tmp/jrebel/jrebel.jar
----

== Neo4j plugin

I have created a simple Neo4j plugin at this url : https://github.com/sim51/neo4j-plugin-xml .
It’s a simple plugin that translate a cypher query to an XML document. for our example it’s perfect.

If you look at the `pom.xml` file, you will notice this following plugin :

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.zeroturnaround</groupId>
    <artifactId>jrebel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${jrebel.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>generate-rebel-xml</id>
            <phase>process-resources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>generate</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

This is the only thing needed to a plugin to be compatible with JRebel. It will generate the JRebel configuration file for you during the maven process, and it’s working out-of-the-box with Neo4j.

In fact JRebel needs a `rebel.xml` file at the root of your jar, to know what to look (ie. your java classes).
You will find all the information about how to configure JRebel at this url : http://manuals.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/standalone/config.html

=== Installation

==== Step 1 : Compiling the code

* Go to the project folder
* Just run `mvn package`

==== Step 2 : installation into Neo4j

* Copy `neo4j-xml-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` from the target project folder to the plugins folder of Neo4j : `$>cp target/neo4j-xml-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar NEO4J_HOME/plugins`
* Edit the file `NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j-server.properties`
* Add / modify the following line : `org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes=org.neo4j.plugin.xml=/xml`
* Restart the server

IMPORTANT: you have a to deploy your plugin a first time before the magic appears !

== The magic part

At this point of the tutorial, you have :

* JRebel installed on your computer
* A working Neo4j server with the JRebel agent
* A working Neo4j plugin deploy into your server that is compatible with Jrebel

So now, it’s time to see magic of JRebel !

Firstly, we will see what the plugin endpoint ping respond to us :

[source,bash]
----
$> curl -u neo4j:admin http://localhost:7474/xml/ping
Pong
----

Now we are going to change the source code, by changing the response of this endpoint in the file `org.neo4j.plugin.xml.PluginExtension` :

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/ping")
public Response ping() throws IOException {
    return Response.ok("I'm here master", MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN).build();
}
----

We have to compile the new code with maven `mvn compile`, for the classes to be generated into the `target/classes` folder. And now, let’s see the result :

[source,bash]
----
$> curl -u neo4j:admin  http://localhost:7474/xml/ping
I'm here master
----

Yeah it’s working, our change is here without any Neo4j restart. Now you can concentrate on your code, so happy coding !

NOTE: If you use an IDE, JRebel has created various plugin and there is probably one for your favorite IDE. Those plugin permit to run/debug a class with JRebel.

NOTE: If you want to save more time, you can let your IDE to compile (incrementaly!) your project automaticly. So each time you are saving a file, your IDE compile the java class into target/classes and JRebel reload it on the server.
