== Goals

In this tutorial you will see how to connect Neo4j to an LDAP server for authentication and authorization (only available with the Enterprise Edition).

== An Openldap server

We need to have a LDAP server with some data.
For this purpose, I will use a docker with the following image : https://github.com/osixia/docker-openldap

By default the domain is `dc=example,dc=org` and the admin is `cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org` with the password `admin`.

We can also pass as an argument to docker, an **ldif** folder for initiate the ldap server with some data.

This is the ldif file that I will use :

[source,ldif]
----
include::../public/images/neo4j-ldap/import.ldif[]
----

As you can see, it only defines :

* an organization unit for **groups** : `ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org`, with the following groups
** group **admin** `cn=admin,ou=groupss,dc=example,dc=org` with the `admin`
** group **architect** `cn=architect,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org` with the `architect`
** group **publisher** `cn=publisher,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org` with the `publisher`
** group **reader** `cn=reader,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org` with the `reader`

* an organization unit for **users** : `ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`, with the following users
** user **admin** `uid=admin,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`
** user **architect** `uid=architect,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`
** user **publisher** `uid=publisher,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`
** user **reader** `uid=reader,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`

In my case, I have stored this ldif file here : /home/bsimard/ldif

This is the command to start our ldap container with the ldif file :

[source,bash]
----
docker run \
   --volume /home/bsimard/ldif/:/container/service/slapd/assets/config/bootstrap/ldif/custom \
   osixia/openldap:1.1.10 \
   --copy-service \
   --loglevel debug
----

== Neo4j configuration

Now we have to tell to Neo4j how to connect to the LDAP.

For this, you just have to edit the `NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` and put those properties :

[source,properties]
----
include::../public/images/neo4j-ldap/neo4j.conf[]
----

Now you can restart Neo4j, and go to the browser to test the connection.

== How it works ?

There is two steps : authentication and authorization.

=== authentication

The authentication is made by a direct bind of the user with the following **DN** : Neo4j replace the user login (ie .`{0}`) in the properties `dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template`.

In the example, if you try to connect with the user `admin`, Neo4j will do a bind with **DN** `uid=admin,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=org`

=== Authorization

Neo4j knows that the user is valid, so it can search for its groups.

Neo4j will use a **system  account** to searh the authorization of users. To do it, it performs :
  * the ldap query configure by **dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter** by replacing the `{0}` with the user's login : `(&(objectClass=*)(uid={0}))`
  * in the DN configure by **dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base** : `ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`

Once it has found the object correspondig to the user, Neo4j will take the attribute configure by **dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes** (so `memberOf` in our example) to have the list of all the user's group, and make the **role** mapping as defined in **dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_to_role_mapping**.


== Good to know

 * The LDAP connector is only available into the **Enterprise Edition**
 * Configuration is simple
 * LDAP groups **must be** linked into users DN (via an attribut like **memberOf** in our case)
 * In this example we have used a **system account** but it's not necessary if users have the right to `BIND` & `SEARCH` themself
