== Goals

In this tutorial you will see how to connect Neo4j to a LDAP server for authentication and authorization (only available with the Enterprise Edition).

== Setup an Openldap server

We need to have a LDAP server with some data.
For this purpose, I will use the following docker image : https://github.com/osixia/docker-openldap

By default the domain is `dc=example,dc=org` and the admin is `cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org` with the password `admin`.

We can pass an argument to docker to add a **ldif** folder for initiate the ldap server with some data at the startup.

This is the ldif file that I use :

[source,ldif]
----
include::../public/images/neo4j-ldap/import.ldif[]
----

As you can see, it only defines :

* an organization unit for **groups** : `ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org`, with the following groups
** group **admin** `cn=admin,ou=groupss,dc=example,dc=org` with the `admin`
** group **architect** `cn=architect,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org` with the `architect`
** group **publisher** `cn=publisher,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org` with the `publisher`
** group **reader** `cn=reader,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org` with the `reader`

* an organization unit for **users** : `ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`, with the following users
** user **admin** `uid=admin,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`
** user **architect** `uid=architect,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`
** user **publisher** `uid=publisher,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`
** user **reader** `uid=reader,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`

INFO: users are must be linked to groups via the `memberOf` attribut

In my case, I have stored this ldif file in this folder `/home/bsimard/ldif`, so the command to start the docker image is the following :

[source,bash]
----
docker run \
   --volume /home/bsimard/ldif/:/container/service/slapd/assets/config/bootstrap/ldif/custom \
   osixia/openldap:1.1.10 \
   --copy-service \
   --loglevel debug
----

== Neo4j configuration

Now we have to configure Neo4j to use the LDAP.
For this, edit the `NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` and put those properties :

[source,properties]
----
include::../public/images/neo4j-ldap/neo4j.conf[]
----

Now you can restart Neo4j, and open the Neo4j browser (http://localhost:7474) to test the connection.

== How it works ?

There is two steps : authentication and authorization.

=== authentication

The authentication is made by a direct bind of the user with the **DN** defined like this : Neo4j replace the user login (ie .`{0}`) in the configuration key **dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template**.

In the example, if you try to connect with the user `admin`, Neo4j will do a bind with `uid=admin,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=org`

=== Authorization

Now Neo4j knows that the user is valid, so it looks up for the user's groups.

For this, it needs a **system  account** to searh the authorizations. To do it, it performs :
  * the ldap query configure by **dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter** by replacing the `{0}` with the user's login : `(&(objectClass=*)(uid={0}))`
  * inside the DN configure by **dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base** : `ou=users,dc=example,dc=org`

Once it has found the correspondig user, it will take the attribute configure by **dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes** (so `memberOf` in our example) to have the list of all the user's group.
Finally, it can makes the **role** mapping as defined in **dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_to_role_mapping**.

== Good to know

 * The LDAP connector is only available into the **Enterprise Edition**
 * Configuration is simple
 * LDAP groups **must be** linked into users DN (via an attribut like **memberOf** in our case)
 * In this example we have used a **system account** but it's not necessary if users have the right to `BIND` & `SEARCH` themself
